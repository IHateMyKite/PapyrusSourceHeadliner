Simple tool created for single purpose, and that is to remove all content from source files, while still keeping it possible to compile scripts using the script
You can basically say that this creats some kind of header file for papyrus, as other scripts can use the header script for compilation, but header doesnt do anything on its own.

HOW TO USE (without console):
1) Open the software
2) Type either name of script (one file will be processed) or name of folder with scripts (all scripts will be processed)

HOW TO USE (with console)
1) Start the software and as argument pass the name of file or folder

Should work on both Windows and Unix (tested on Ubuntu WSL and Windows 10)
